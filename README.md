A personalised spam filter that enhances basic Bayesian filter by consuming user interests and social closeness to detect spam. Sender's activity determines his 'trustworthiness' and every users' trust scores are adapted accordingly. Spammer monitoring system keeps track of the trust scores and notifies users if a spammer is found in the immediate network of the user.
