# Personalised SpamFilter using Social Network #
A personalised spam filter that enhances basic Bayesian filter by consuming user interests and social closeness to detect spam. Sender's activity determines his 'trustworthiness' and every users' trust scores are adapted accordingly. Spammer monitoring system keeps track of the trust scores and notifies users if a spammer is found in the immediate network of the user. This idea is based on the paper ["SOAP: A Social network Aided Personalized and effective spam filter to clean your e-mail box," 2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM, Shanghai, 2011"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934984&isnumber=5934870)
